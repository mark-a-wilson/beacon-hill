          <p class="divisionDescription">In Mini Minors, children receive additional instruction on the fundamentals of baseball â€“ hitting, throwing, catching, running and fielding â€“ with emphasis on playing positions in the field and good sportsmanship during game play.  Players start the season by hitting from coach pitch, but after the May long weekend they will have the opportunity to practice hitting from player/coach pitch in addition to practicing pitching themselves if desired. Mini Minor games consist of 4 innings (maximum 2 hours long) with each player getting a turn at bat and all players playing the field in every inning.  During a game, each team will have 3 outs or a maximum of 3 runs per at bat per inning.  Suitable for both aspiring baseball and softball players (co-ed). If appropriate, 8 year old players who demonstrate the required level of skill and maturity may be assessed for Minors Baseball (co-ed) or Minors Softball (girls).</p>
