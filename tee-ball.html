            <div class="divisionDescription">T-Ball provides an introduction to organized baseball and team play. Children are instructed on the fundamentals of baseball â€“ hitting, throwing, catching, running and fielding â€“ with a lot coaching and parent support in a fun game environment. Players start the season by batting off a stationary tee, but may have the opportunity to be pitched to by the coach before the end of the season. T-Ball games consist of 3 or 4 innings with each player getting a turn at bat. Game length will be no more than 90 minutes.  During a game, there are SAFEâ€™s and OUTâ€™s on bases, but no scores are kept. Coaches are allowed on the field to assist the players with hitting and fielding.  Suitable for both aspiring baseball and softball players (co-ed).  If appropriate, 6 year old players who demonstrate the required level of skill and maturity may be assessed for Mini-Minors.  It is also possible for 7 year old players to participate in T-Ball when appropriate.</div>
