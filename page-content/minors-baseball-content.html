    <p class="divisionDescription">Time to play baseball!  Kids pitch from a 46â€™ pitching mound during regulation baseball games (six innings).  Players continue to develop their baseball skills with a focus on good sportsmanship.  Base stealing is allowed (no lead offs).  Umpires are provided for each game.  Both boys and girls aged 9 & 10 are welcome at this age, with the occasional skilled 7 or 8 year-old.</p>
    <p>The Minors Division has a tournament team which will play in the District 7 (city-wide) Championships during the first week of July. The winner moves on to Provincials!</p>
