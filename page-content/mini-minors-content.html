    <p class="divisionDescription">In Mini Minors, children receive additional instruction on the fundamentals of baseball – hitting, throwing, catching, running and fielding – with emphasis on playing positions in the field and good sportsmanship during game play.</p>  
    <p>Players start the season by hitting from coach pitch, but after the May long weekend they will have the opportunity to practice hitting from player/coach pitch in addition to practicing pitching themselves if desired. Mini Minor games consist of 4 innings (maximum 2 hours long) with each player getting a turn at bat and all players playing the field in every inning.  During a game, each team will have 3 outs or a maximum of 3 runs per at bat per inning.  Suitable for both aspiring baseball and softball players (co-ed). If appropriate, 8 year old players who demonstrate the required level of skill and maturity may be assessed for Minors Baseball (co-ed) or Minors Softball (girls).</p>
