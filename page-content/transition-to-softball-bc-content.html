    <p>Beacon Hill Baseball and Softball Association (BHBSA) is a not for profit organization incorporated under the B.C. Societies Act.  It is run by volunteers, mainly parents of existing or past players.  Beacon Hill Little League was formed in 1973 when Fairfield Little League and James Bay Little League combined.  Beacon Hill Little League added softball in 1997 and has fielded teams affiliated with Little League International for over 60 years.</p>
    <p>Following our 62nd season in 2018, the BHBSA membership expressed an interest in moving the softball program from Little League to Softball BC to provide more opportunities for our softball players to experience a wider range of competition and to play against more organizations than are available to Little League softball teams in Greater Victoria.  BHBSA is excited to announce that starting in 2019, Beacon Hill’s softball teams have affiliated with Softball Canada and Softball BC.</p>
    <p>The decision to move to Softball BC has been a difficult one.  BHBSA is committed to sharing information with its members about the decision and has prepared the following FAQs to help explain the change.</p>
