  <div class="container-narrow">
    <p>Beacon Hill Baseball and Softball Association (BHBSA) is a not for profit organization incorporated under the B.C. Societies Act.  It is run by volunteers, mainly parents of existing or past players.  Beacon Hill Little League was formed in 1973 when Fairfield Little League and James Bay Little League combined.  Beacon Hill Little League added softball in 1997 and has fielded teams affiliated with Little League International for over 60 years.</p>
    <p>Following our 62nd season in 2018, the BHBSA membership expressed an interest in moving the softball program from Little League to Softball BC to provide more opportunities for our softball players to experience a wider range of competition and to play against more organizations than are available to Little League softball teams in Greater Victoria.  BHBSA is excited to announce that starting in 2019, Beacon Hill’s softball teams have affiliated with Softball Canada and Softball BC.</p>
    <p>The decision to move to Softball BC has been a difficult one.  BHBSA is committed to sharing information with its members about the decision and has prepared the following FAQs to help explain the change.</p>
    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <h4>Is Beacon Hill’s softball program moving from Little League to Softball BC?</h4>
    <p>Yes.</p>
    <h4>What is the difference between the softball programs for Little League and Softball BC?</h4>
    <p>Overall the game is the same with some minor rule differences.  The age groupings are different as Softball BC is organized by birth year in 2 year intervals, for example, U14 (born 2005 & 2006), U12 (born 2007 & 2008), U10 (born 2009 & 2010), etc.</p>
    <h4>Which groups of softball are moving to Softball BC?  Which age groups will remain as Little League?</h4>
    <p>All younger players will be invited to play BlastBall (co-ed ages 3-4), T-Ball (co-ed ages 5-6) or Mini-Minors (co-ed ages 7-8). Starting at U10 (born 2009 or 2010), girls will have the option of joining our softball program.</p>
    <h4>Does my daughter need to play softball or can she still play baseball as she gets older?</h4>
    <p>Baseball will remain co-ed and your daughter will always be welcome to play baseball.</p>
    <h4>What other associations are involved with Softball BC compared to Little League in Victoria?</h4>
    <p>Softball BC members include View Royal, Langford, Duncan, Sooke, Lakehill, Peninsula, Cordova Bay, Strawberry Vale, Carnarvon, Gordon Head and Central Saanich.  The remaining Little League clubs are Layritz, National and Hampton.</p>
    <h4>How will this affect Beacon Hill’s baseball program?</h4>
    <p>BHBSA’s affiliation with Softball BC will not affect Beacon Hill’s baseball program which will continue to be affiliated with Little League International.  The only change our baseball teams will see is that Pemberton Park will become a dedicated field for softball.  Since there will be no mound at Pemberton Park, it will not be suitable for baseball games and all Major and Minor baseball games will be played at Hollywood Park.</p>
    <h4>Can I still volunteer to coach?  Do I have to be certified?</h4>
    <p>We are 100% volunteer run program and the success of any organization is because of the strength of the volunteers.  We encourage anyone that has the coaching zeal to put your name forward to coach.  Yes, there are certain requirements at the different levels. (‘C’ level is house and ‘B’ level is the next level up and is more competitive.) For the ‘C’ level, ‘Learn to Coach’ (1 day training), the Community Coach (2 day training) and Making Ethical Decisions (online evaluation) are all recommended, until U14 when these become a requirement.</p>
    <h4>Is there a cost associated with coaching certification and who bears the cost?</h4>
    <p>Yes, there is a minor cost for coaching certification; the park will bear the cost.</p>
    <h4>Where will games and practices be held?</h4>
    <p>As part of moving to Softball BC, Beacon Hill will be designating Pemberton Park as the official softball field for games.  Practices will be held at Pemberton, Brooke Field and Hollywood Park (batting cage).</p>
    <h4>Will there be a concession at Pemberton Park?</h4>
    <p>Yes. The large grey storage bin that previously blocked the sightline between the concession and the ball field has recently been relocated and re-purposed by the City of Victoria.  A keen member of our parent community has secured a grant to install a picnic table on the remaining cement pad in front of the concession. Plans are in the works to make food and drinks available for purchase at Pemberton Park on game days.</p>
    <h4>What are the registration costs?</h4>
    <p>Beacon Hill will charge softball registration fees that are in line with our baseball registration fees.  Softball registration fees for girls aged 8 & up will be between $175 and $225 for the season.  There will be no additional volunteer deposits, concession fees or fundraising fees.</p>
    <h4>When does registration open?</h4>
    <p>Online registration opens January 1st, 2020.</p>
    <h4>How long is the season?</h4>
    <p>The season runs from April to June.  Teams may qualify for tournaments that will continue into the summer.  Beacon Hill will also run clinics for baseball and softball each fall and winter.</p>
    <h4>What equipment or uniforms are needed?</h4>
    <p>Players will need to provide their own batting helmets with a cage.  All else is provided but if players want their own bats for example, they may do so at their own cost.</p>
    <h4>What is the difference between ‘B’ and ‘C’ Level?</h4>
    <p>‘C’ is strictly a recreational or house team and ‘B’ is a competitive level which usually involves additional cost over and above the basic registration fees.</p>
    <h4>What is a Softball BC number, why is it needed and how do I get one?</h4>
    <p>In order to play with Softball BC, each player will require a one-time $10 Lifetime Membership with Softball BC for insurance purposes.  We will direct you to the Softball BC website at the time of registration to complete your membership application and payment.</p>
    <h4>My daughter is XX years old.  What division will she be placed in?</h4>
    <p>Your child’s birth year will determine her division of play.  The age divisions for Softball BC are U10 (born 2009 & 2010), U12 (born 2007 & 2008), U14 (born 2005 & 2006), U16 (born 2003 & 2004) & U18 (born 2001 & 2002).  If your daughter is born 2011 or later, she will be able to play BlastBall (ages 3-4), T-Ball (ages 5-6) or Mini-Minors (ages 7-8).</p>
    <h4>What are the opportunities for competitive girls?</h4>
    <p>There will be regional, provincial and national championships.  More opportunities may become available as the season gets underway.</p>
    <h4>Is there more travel involved?</h4>
    <p>Yes, there will most likely be more travel as there are more teams in each of the divisions to schedule.  There may be occasional games as far away as Duncan or SaltSpring Island.</p>
    <h4>What if I have more questions that have not yet been answered?</h4>
    <p>More information can be found on the <a href="https://softball.bc.ca/">Softball BC website</a>, or you can contact our Vice President of Softball, Yudy Lee, with questions: nickmeg@shaw.ca</p>
